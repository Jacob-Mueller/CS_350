# CS_350
Embedded Systems on the CC3220x-LaunchXL Dev Kit from Texas Instruments

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The final project was a thermostat project that measured temperature and allowed students to practice the utilization of multiple peripherals. The third milestone was an excersize in timing, blinking lights, and button manipulation; sos in morse code was exciting to see once it was done properly.

What did you do particularly well?

I think that identifying what needed to be worked on was something I grew better at doing as we moved along, and labelling my coding blocks was imperative to these projects.

Where could you improve?

I could still use some practice in the above examples, you can never get enough practice identifying the behaviors of a system or labelling them for other members of a development team.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

When available I would reference a manual or some similar documentation more often, I know that there are often resources available for toolkits or languages that I could use in the same manner as the TI technical manual used in the course.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Some experience with C is going to be game changing as that specialized or niche ability will come in handy if I am able to get a job working in a software role for manufacturing and fabrication. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I would like to say that my labels will add a lot of explanation but I think that there is room for more explanations as I go through a project. Just because I didn't get lost to often doesn't mean that someone else looking at the project will understand what I am trying to convey in my code.
